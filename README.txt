If you want to build the project yourself (and maybe modify it), you'll
need a Linux system with Pike, Perl, acme and dasm.  Your Pike needs to be
able to find the modules in the pmods/ directory, and your Linux needs to 
have access to the programs in bin/.

Build system is written mostly in bash and Pike.  Main entry point is the 
file 'buildme.sh' in the src/ directory.

Holes are designed using 'Tiled'.
